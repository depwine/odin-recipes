<li><h2>How to Make Meatball Subs</h2></li>
<p>This meatball sub starts by making homemade meatballs, then assembling the sandwich. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a quick overview of what you can expect:
</p>
<li><h2>Make the Meatballs</h2></li>
<p>Mix the ground beef, bread crumbs, eggs, garlic, Parmesan, and spices with your hands. Shape into evenly sized meatballs and bake until they reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F.
</p>
<li><h2>Prep the Bread</h2></li>
<p>Cut the baguette in half (lengthwise) and scoop out some of the bread to make room for the meatballs. Brush olive oil over the bread and sprinkle with seasonings. Bake in the oven until lightly toasted.
</p>
<li><h2>Make the Sauce</h2></li>
<p>Heat a jar of spaghetti sauce on the stove. Once cooked, transfer the meatballs to the sauce and mix them until coated.
</p>
<li><h2>Assemble the Sandwich</h2></li>
<p>Spoon meatballs and sauce into the baguette. Top with provolone cheese. Bake the entire sandwich until the cheese is melted.

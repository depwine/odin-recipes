    <p>This mushroom soup is creamy and rich — it's one of my favorite soups of all time and it's so easy! The long, slow caramelization of the mushrooms requires a little patience, but it really unlocks their magical flavor, which is the secret to this mushroom soup.</p>

<p>How to Make Creamy Mushroom Soup
    Luscious, herb-infused mushroom soup is just a few steps away. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe:
    
    Begin by melting butter in a large saucepan and caramelizing the mushrooms — it's important to cook them until a deep golden color is achieved for maximum flavor. Add onions, thyme, garlic, and broth to the mixture before simmering. 
    
    Next, puree the soup mixture with an immersion blender and add cream. Season to taste, garnish with thyme sprigs, and enjoy a hot bowl of deeply decadent flavor. 
</p>
<div class="section">Step 1</div>

<p>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and 1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<div class="section">Step 2</div>
<p>Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired.</p>
<div class="section">Step 3</div>
<p>Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
<div class="section">Step 4</div>
<p>Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, to remove the raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.</p>
<div class="section">Step 5</div>
<p>Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme bundle.</p>
<div class="section">Step 6</div>
<p>Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth and thick. Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. Season with salt and black pepper.</p>
<div class="section">Step 7</div>
<p>Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.
